## What I learned
- Types of NoSQL databases
  - document databases
  - key-value databases
  - wide-column stores
    - Wide-column stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns. 
  - graph databases
    - Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things (like nouns), while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes. 

  - NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility.

- Misconception
  - 1. relationship data is best suited for relational databases.
  - 2. NoSQL databases don't support ACID transactions
