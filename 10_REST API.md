## What I learned
- REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
- REST is based on some constraints and principles

- In simple words, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).
