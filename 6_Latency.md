## What I learned
- Latency is the time it takes for data to pass from one point on a network to another.
  - Most often, latency is measured between a user's device (the "client" device) and a data center. 
- round trip time (RTT)
  - The amount of time it takes for a response to reach a client device after a client request
- Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can pass through the network at any given time.
- One of the principal causes of network latency is distance.
- Use of a CDN (content delivery network) is a major step towards reducing latency.
