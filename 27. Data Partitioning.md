## What I learned
- Database partitioning (also called data partitioning) refers to breaking the data in an applicationâ€™s database into separate pieces, or partitions. These partitions can then be stored, accessed, and managed separately.
- Vertical partitioning
  - Vertical partitioning is when the table is split by columns, with different columns stored on different partitions.
- Horizontal partitioning
  - Horizontal partitioning is when the table is split by rows, with different ranges of rows stored on different partitions.
- A distributed SQL database is a next-generation SQL database that has been designed with data partitioning in mind.
