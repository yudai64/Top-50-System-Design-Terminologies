## What I learned
- Online transaction processing (OLTP) is a type of database system used in transaction-oriented applications, such as many operational systems.
- OLTP has also been used to refer to processing in which the system responds immediately to user requests. An automated teller machine (ATM) for a bank is an example of a commercial transaction processing application.
