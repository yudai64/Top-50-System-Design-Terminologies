## What I learned
- Rate limiting is a technique used to control the rate at which requests are made to a network, server, or other resource.
- Rate limiting can be implemented at the network level, by setting limits on the rate of traffic or on the number of requests made to specific resources, or at the application level, by setting limits on the number of requests made by individual users or clients
