## What I learned
- A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence.
- A data warehouse may contain multiple databases. Within each database, data is organized into tables and columns.
