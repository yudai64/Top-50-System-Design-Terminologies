- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eventual-vs-strong-consistency-in-distributed-databases/

## What I learned
- Strong Consistency simply means the data must be strongly consistent at all times. All the server nodes across the world should contain the same value as an entity at any point in time.
- The nodes must be locked down for updates. Queuing all requests is one good way of making a system Strongly Consistent.

## English words I learned
- [ ] optimistic
