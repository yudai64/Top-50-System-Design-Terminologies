## What I learned
- Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development.
  - software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.
- Benefits (e.g.)
  - Agility
    - Teams act within a small and well understood context and are empowered to work more independently and more quickly. This shortens development cycle times. 
  - Flexible Scaling
  - Easy Deployment
    - Microservices enable continuous integration and continuous delivery. So it is easy to try out new ideas and to roll back if something doesnâ€™t work.
