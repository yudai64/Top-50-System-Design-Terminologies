## What I learned
- Throughput is a measure of how many units of information a system can process in a given amount of time.
- Throughput vs. network bandwidth
  - Throughput is necessarily lower than bandwidth because bandwidth represents the maximum capabilities of a network rather than the actual transfer rate.
