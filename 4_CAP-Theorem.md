# CAP Theorem
- https://www.scylladb.com/glossary/cap-theorem/

## What I learned
- Any distributed system or data store can simultaneously provide only two of three guarantees: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance (CAP).
- Although CAP theorem stating a CA distributed database is possible exists, there is currently no true CA distributed database system.
- PACELC
  - Traditional CAP theorem provides for neither latency nor performance.
  - PACELC extends the CAP theorem by introducing latency and consistency as additional attributes of distributed systems. 
  - PACELC reveals that systems tend either towards strong consistency or latency sensitivity. Even in the absence of partitioning, a trade-off between consistency and latency exists.
