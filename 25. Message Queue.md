# Message Queue
- https://aws.amazon.com/message-queue/

## What I learned
- A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. 
- each message is processed only once
  - Many producers and consumers can use the queue, but each message is processed only once, by a single consumer.
  - When a message needs to be processed by more than one consumer, message queues can be combined with Pub/Sub messaging in a fanout design pattern.
